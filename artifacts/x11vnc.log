26/01/2026 14:09:14 
26/01/2026 14:09:14 Wireframing: -wireframe mode is in effect for window moves.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
26/01/2026 14:09:14   errors, etc) it may be disabled:
26/01/2026 14:09:14    - use '-nowf' to disable wireframing completely.
26/01/2026 14:09:14    - use '-nowcr' to disable the Copy Rectangle after the
26/01/2026 14:09:14      moved window is released in the new position.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
26/01/2026 14:09:14   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
26/01/2026 14:09:14   periodic repaints.
26/01/2026 14:09:14 
26/01/2026 14:09:14 XFIXES available on display, resetting cursor mode
26/01/2026 14:09:14   to: '-cursor most'.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   to disable this behavior use: '-cursor arrow'
26/01/2026 14:09:14   or '-noxfixes'.
26/01/2026 14:09:14 using XFIXES for cursor drawing.
26/01/2026 14:09:14 GrabServer control via XTEST.
26/01/2026 14:09:14 
26/01/2026 14:09:14 Scroll Detection: -scrollcopyrect mode is in effect to
26/01/2026 14:09:14   use RECORD extension to try to detect scrolling windows
26/01/2026 14:09:14   (induced by either user keystroke or mouse input).
26/01/2026 14:09:14   If this yields undesired behavior (poor response, painting
26/01/2026 14:09:14   errors, etc) it may be disabled via: '-noscr'
26/01/2026 14:09:14   Also see the -help entry for tuning parameters.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   You can press 3 Alt_L's (Left "Alt" key) in a row to 
26/01/2026 14:09:14   repaint the screen, also see the -fixscreen option for
26/01/2026 14:09:14   periodic repaints.
26/01/2026 14:09:14 
26/01/2026 14:09:14 XKEYBOARD: number of keysyms per keycode 7 is greater
26/01/2026 14:09:14   than 4 and 51 keysyms are mapped above 4.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   Automatically switching to -xkb mode.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   If this makes the key mapping worse you can
26/01/2026 14:09:14   disable it with the "-noxkb" option.
26/01/2026 14:09:14   Also, remember "-remap DEAD" for accenting characters.

******************************************************************************
Have you tried the x11vnc '-ncache' VNC client-side pixel caching feature yet?

The scheme stores pixel data offscreen on the VNC viewer side for faster
retrieval.  It should work with any VNC viewer.  Try it by running:

    x11vnc -ncache 10 ...

One can also add -ncache_cr for smooth 'copyrect' window motion.
